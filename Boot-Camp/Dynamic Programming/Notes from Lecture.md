## DP (Dynamic Programming) has Two Key Attributes:

1.  Optimal Substructure - USE Sub-problems
2.  Overlapping Sub-problems - RE-USE Sub-problems

## Two ways of Implementing DP Solutions - Tabulation and Memoization

1.  Top Down - Recursion + Memoization
2.  Bottom Up - Tabulation

## Approaching Dynamic Programming Problems

1.  Find relationship between problem and its sub-problems -> USE & RE-USE
2.  Implement the code:

- - Recursion + Memoization (Top Down)
    - Tabulation (Bottom Up)

Q for self:

1.  What are the subproblems
2.  Which of those subproblems can we use
3.  What it the relationship with these subproblems
