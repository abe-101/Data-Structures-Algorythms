## Power

**Level**: Easy

Power Function: Implement a function to calculate X^N. Both X and N can be positive or negative. You can assume that overflow doesn't happen.
(Try doing it in O(log(N))time)

For example:  
2 ^ 2 = 4  
2 ^ -2 = 0.25  
-2 ^ 3 = -8  

Questions to Clarify:
Q. Are both X and N integers?  
A. Yes  

Q. Can the number be both negative and positive?  
A. Yes  

Q. Can the power be negative?  
A. Yes  

Q. Can we assume that the result won't overflow?  
A. Yes, you can assume that.  

Q. 0^0 or 0^-3 (or any negative number) is undefined. How do we return that?  
A. Throw an exception.
